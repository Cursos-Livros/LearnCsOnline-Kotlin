/**
 * Internally, computers represent everything as a number. But they can still store and process all kinds of information—from simple numbers to photos to music to the
 * entire human genome. You'll learn more about how they can do that as you go along.
 *
 * In Kotlin, as long as we provide an initial value when we declare a variable the compiler can usually guess—or infer—what the type is. The variable still has a type,
 * and Kotlin will make sure that we don't change its type later. Assigning a type to each variable help us write more correct programs. For example, it doesn't make
 * sense to try and add a boolean value (true or false) to an integer value (1, 2, etc.). But, unlike some other languages, in Kotlin we don't always need to provide
 * an explicit type.
 *
 * Let's get practice working with some of Kotlin's simplest or primitive data types. Write a snippet of code—not a function— that:
 *
 * declares a variable (var) count of type Int and initializes it to 88
 * declares a variable named temperature of type Double and initializes it to 14.3
 * declares a variable letter of type Char and initializes it to X
 * declares a variable named isCSAwesome of type Boolean and initializes it to true
