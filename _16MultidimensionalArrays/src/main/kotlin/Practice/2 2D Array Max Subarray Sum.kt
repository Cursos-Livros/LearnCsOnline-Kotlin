/**
 * Write a function maxSubarraySum that, given a non-rectangular two-dimensional non-nullable Int array,
 * returns the sum of the subarray that sums to the largest value.
 *
 * So given the following array, with each subarray on a separate line:
 *
 * 1, 2, 4
 * 4, 1, -1
 * 6, 8, -10, -9
 * -1
 * You would return 7. The passed array will contain no empty subarrays.
 *
 * One hint for this problem is that you may need both an Int variable to store the max and a Boolean variable to record whether the maximum
 * value has been initialized. Once you have summed each subarray, check whether either your Boolean value is false or the sum is larger
 * than the largest you've seen so far. After you check the sum of the first subarray, set your Boolean value to true.
 * Another approach is to use the counter that you use to proceed through each subarray to determine whether you have initialized the max
 * value.
