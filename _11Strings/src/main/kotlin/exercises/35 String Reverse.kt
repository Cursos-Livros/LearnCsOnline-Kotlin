/**
 * Let's get some more practice working with Strings: an incredibly useful data type for working with text.
 *
 * Write a function called reverse. It should accept a single String argument and return that String, reversed!
 * There are several ways to approach this problemâ€”have fun!
 * And maybe take a good look at the documentation before you write too much code...
